AI Voice Agent

This AI Voice Agent is a conversational assistant built using cutting-edge technologies like Ollama, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Speech Recognition. 
The agent is designed to engage in natural, seamless communication with users by processing their voice commands and responding in a human-like manner.

Technologies Used:
Ollama: A powerful AI platform that serves as the core for text generation and natural language understanding. It enables the AI to generate human-like responses to user inputs.

spaCy: A robust NLP library for intent recognition and text processing, allowing the agent to understand and interpret user commands more effectively.

SpeechRecognition: A Python library that converts user speech into text, making voice interaction possible.

pyttsx3: A text-to-speech library that converts generated text responses into speech, providing the agent with a voice.

Python: The primary programming language used to implement the logic and integrate all the technologies.

Functionality:The agent listens to voice commands, processes the input using spaCy for NLP, generates a response using Ollama's powerful models, and then speaks the response back to the user. 
The entire interaction happens seamlessly, making it feel like a natural conversation.
